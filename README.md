# Multi-Functional-Robot-For-Defense
This project describes the design and implementation of multifunctional defense robots that assist in risky jobs typically performed by soldiers.1. Detect landmines using a metal detector. 2. Measure object distance with an ultrasonic sensor. 3. Alert operators with a buzzer and data display. 4. Operate at night using night‑vision cameras.
